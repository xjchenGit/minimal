# Minimal Theme - Personal Homepage

[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/demo-online-brightgreen)](https://orderedlist.com/minimal/)

This is my personal homepage, built using the **Minimal** theme. 

## Credits & Attributions
This project is based on the [Minimal Theme](https://github.com/orderedlist/minimal) originally created by [orderedlist](https://github.com/orderedlist). I have customized the content and structure to serve as my professional portfolio/homepage.

## Key Features
* **GitHub Pages Integration**: Fully compatible with the official GitHub Pages hosting service.
* **Syntax Highlighting**: Beautiful code snippets powered by [Pygments](http://pygments.org).
* **Responsive Design**: Optimized for a clean, distraction-free reading experience across all devices.

## Local Development

To preview the homepage on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Open your terminal** and navigate to the project directory.
2. **Start a local server** using Python:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
